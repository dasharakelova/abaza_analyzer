# abaza_analyzer

# Background
Abaza is a Northwest Caucasian language spoken mainly in Russia. This repository contains a prototype for Abaza morphological analyzer built based on transducer technology. A detailed descritpions can be found in [this paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-jmHmJKq803GnBjPasgo-X8pdjsX88qaX1eYLcp17Og/edit#heading=h.qh6q32f1bcbj).

The analyzer is a part of a larger project at NRU HSE designing NLP tools for low-resource languiages. A demo of a web interface for all the projects including this one can be found [here](http://87.247.157.119:5000/parsers).
