a collection of scripts for analysing hfst generators

Scripts perform analysis of tests pairs against the transducer,
identifying missing stems/lemmas and noting forms with slightly
disagreeing glosses/analyses.

The scripts come *sigh* in the form of a makefile and some bash
scripts, and are run on all files matching `*-test`.

A stupid and deliberately incorrect English verb generator is included
as a sample.
